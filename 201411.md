## What was November of 2014 all about?

3 out of the 4 people in my family had birthdays (myself included, 26, ahhhh). My brother and I were both home for Thanksgiving in Colorado. I went to a weird number of sporting events. Bossed out running at altitude for a few weeks.

I guess I was too busy to make a big playlist!
