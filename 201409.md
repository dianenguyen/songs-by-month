## What was September of 2014 all about?

I spent a lot of time in Paris, France. I spent a lot of time communicating with people I care about. I saw Stromae in concert, dealt with an Air France strike, and was so pensive all the time I didn't run as often as I normally do. An increasing number of doubts crept into my mind about the worthwhileness of toughing it out in tech, but at month's end, I was still netting out positively.
